The repository contains the results of PARCH analysis conducted on fourteen proteins using the TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, and TIP5P water models. 
The subfolders are named after the respective proteins and contain the following files in each of them:
- four PDB files of the protein tested with different water models, with PARCH values written as B-factors. 
- a CSV file summarizing the PARCH results across different water models.
- a PyMOL session file displaying the protein surface, colored (green-yellow-purple) according to PARCH values (0â€“1).
